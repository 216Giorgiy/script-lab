    <p>
        You can use the<a href="index.html">Office Add-in Playground site</a> 
        from a web browser to look through Office.js code samples, or to view shared snippets.
        But in order to run the code,. you will need to do so from within an Office application (Excel, Word, etc.),
        and you will need to have acquired the Add-in.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can acquire the add-in in two ways:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Search for the "Office Add-in Playground" add-in in the 
                <a href="https://store.office.com/" target="_blank">Office Store</a> website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Search and insert the add-in straight from within an Office application, by choosing
                the <b>Insert</b> tab in the Ribbon, followed by the <b>Store</b> button
                in the <b>Add-ins</b> group.
                <img src="./assets/images/store-button.png" />
            </li>
        </li>
    </p>

    <p>
        Having acquired the Add-in, choose the <b>My Add-ins</b> button
        (also under the <b>Insert</b> tab in the ribbon), and select the add-in from the dialog that appears.
    </p>

    <p>
        From there on out, on newer builds of Office, you should see the add-in appear in your <b>Home</b> tab.
        Otherwise, continue to insert it from <b>Insert</b>==&gt;<b>My Add-ins</b>
