# This is a very early beta!

The basic flows should all work, but with some awkward moments.  Namely, you should be able to:
* Create => Edit => Run.
* Switch between snippets.
* Editor IntelliSense.
* Ability to share.
* Ability to import from "clipboard-copied" YAML file or from GIST ID (both "new-style" gists and old).

The awkwardness is primarily around the editor/runner interaction.  It will be looked at by our Designer, who will propose what sort of interaction model would be easier.

Any issues should be logged into the appropriate milestones at <https://github.com/OfficeDev/addin-playground/milestones>.  One bug (or group of related bugs) per issue.
